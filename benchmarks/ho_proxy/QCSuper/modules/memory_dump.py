"""
    This module is meant to dump the memory from a QCDM device. It will better
    work on older devices (e.g the Qualcomm Icon 225 from 2008, as presented in
    research from Guillaume Delugr√©), on other it will work on certain memory ranges,
    on some it will not work at all.
    
    This module creates an output directory where raw memory chunks will be
    written using filenames like "chunk_<start address>".
"""

"""
    The Diag commands purporting to read the memory allow only reading a word
    of memory at once.

    In order to find the readable memory ranges faster when only certain are,
    it will seek through memory by increments of 0x1000 bytes (state
    LOOKING_FORWARD_1000_BY_1000) until one is found.
    
    When an offset pertaining to a readable chunk is found, it will seek
    backwards one word at once (LOOKING_BACKWARDS_10_BY_10) until the beginning
    of this chunk is found.
    
    Once done, it reads it sequentially (READING_FORWARD_10_BY_10).
