# Benchmarks (Î¼TCell)


### Setup (EC2 VM)
* MPTCP Enabled (v0.94) AMI: `ami-06b93cd6edfe1ee9f` (perfd-cellular-stage-5, us-west-1)
* MPTCP Disabled AMI: `ami-0849b21b423a6baaa` (perfd-cellular-mptcp_disabled, us-west-1)

These AMI include mobile applications (more to be added in the long run) with datasets and scripts to start benchmarking, described in what follows. 
* Network benchmarks: iperf/iperf3, wrk 
* Video streaming (RTMP, HLS):  nginx-rtmp-module, ffmpeg
* Multimedia communication (e.g. SIP, RTP): [PJSIP](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject)
* Web: [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy)

Pre-built docker image silveryfu/celleval:app (to be used with the tunnel setup, see /ho_proxy) includes the application benchmarks (same as the AMIs) and can be used at both the client- and server-side.

>TBD run application benchmarks on VM

### Setup (Docker container)

Applications are located in the /home directory of the container image:
```
root@bee1ebeb501a:/# ls /home
iperf  sip  video  web
```

#### iperf (iperf3)
* Refer to `man iperf3`
* Note: use `iperf3 -R` from the UE side to let the server to send traffic; current MPTCP implementation has a "server_side" flag that prohibits non TCP initiator to start subflow.
* Note: for all benchmarks remember to configure the EC2 security groups to allow traffic of the particular protocols and ports.

#### web page loading
* `cd /home/web`
* Server-side: `make web`
* Client-side: `make client` (run `make test` first to check if the server is running)
* The client side will generate a web request every second and reports the completion time

#### video streaming
On server:
* Mount video clips from the host/VM to the container, i.e., ` -v /mnt/clips:/mnt/clips` 
* Start nginx: run `make video` under `/home/video`
* Start streaming: run `FILE=../clips/[videofile] make stream-an` under `/mnt/hls/`

On client (hls.js):
* Start nginx: `make web` under `/home/web`
* Start firefox: `firefox`; use the private mode to avoid cache
* Open player: `localhost/demo/`

On client (ffplay):
* Start player: run `make play` under `/home/video`

Recommended clips:
* https://mirror.clarkson.edu/blender/demo/movies/BBB/

Sample clips on VM:
* 480p clip: `/mnt/clips/bun480p.mp4` (33s; default, played in a loop by `make stream`!)
* 1080p clip: `/mnt/clips/greenland.mp4` (159s)

#### SIP (PJSIP)

* Mount audio clips from the host/VM to the container, i.e., `-v /mnt/audio:/mnt/audio`
* `cd /home/sip`
* At server: `make recv`
* At client: `make call`

Calling known SIP account:
* Register a SIP account (e.g., onsip.com, optional)
* Run pjproject/pjsip-apps/bin/[binary] with --null-audio option
* [WIP]

### Docker commands

Server:
```
docker run -v /mnt/clips:/mnt/clips -v /mnt/audio:/mnt/audio --name=uec -itd --privileged silveryfu/celleval:app
```

Client:
```
docker run -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --device /dev/snd --privileged --name=uec -itd silveryfu/celleval:app
```
And include any other options required for ho_proxy setup (see ./ho_proxy).
